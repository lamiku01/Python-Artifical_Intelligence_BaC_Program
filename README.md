# Python-Artifical_Intelligence_BaC_Program

This program was written and designed as a team final project for our Artificial Intelligence course. The objective was to use a genetic algorithm in combination with a wisdom of the Crowds approaach to solve a NP-complete problem of our choice. This program solves the game Bulls and Cows (BaC). BaC is a two-player game with the objective of guessing an opponentâ€™s secret number or word. More detailed explainations and anyalysis of the program can be found in the attached research paper written by me and the other team members.
